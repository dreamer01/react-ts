# React TS Starter

Wanted to create a simple starter for the React + TS but, the vite.js template does is best and it would unnecessary to setup something else at this time.

## What Next Then

Will try to build on this starter for learning, like

- Adding support for CSS Modules
- React Router V6
- Post CSS support
